# Bubble Sort Visualization(Completed)
This is a simple web application that visualizes the Bubble Sort algorithm. The algorithm sorts an array of numbers in ascending order by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The visualization shows each step of the algorithm by displaying a bar graph of the array after each comparison and swap.

## Usage
To use the application, follow these steps:

* Open the index.html file in your web browser.
* Enter a comma-separated list of numbers into the text input field.
* Click the "Sort" button to start the Bubble Sort algorithm.
*The bars representing the numbers will be updated to show each step of the algorithm.
